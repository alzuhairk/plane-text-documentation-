I am going to use the two links above to do my research and use the information I learn to write my paper

Pollution, as defined by Merriam Webster, is the process of making the environment not safe or suitable to use. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy. We, humans, should understand what pollution is, what its causes are, and how they affect us. In this paper I am will discuss the effects of air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution. Then I will conclude by examining how we handle the issue of pollution. 

Air pollution is the most permanent and dangerous type of pollution. It is defined as the release of both natural and manmade substances to the atmosphere. It includes the burning of fossil fuels in vehicle engines and in industries, dangerous gases like sulfur dioxide, tobacco smoke, and dust. The effects of air pollution are enormous; sulfur dioxide and other harmful gases contribute in global warming. Breathing polluted air can also lead to diseases like asthma and cancer.

Water pollution is the release of contaminates to the water, which is usually caused by water littering. It takes many forms including disposing trash directly in the water, dumping industrial waste in the marine, and spilling oil accidentally. Water pollution directly affects the aquatic beings, which in turn affects humans depending on these through the food chain causing serious diseases such as cholera. Water pollution is an alarming issue because water is an easy solvent, which allows pollutants to easily dissolve in it.    

Soil or land pollution is the destruction of earth’s surface and soil. It can take many forms including deforestation and soil erosions, agricultural activates, construction activities, and nuclear waste. These types of soil pollution can have sever effects on the environment. Deforestation and construction activates directly harm the wildlife by destroying their habitat. Land pollution can also have serious effects on human health; it can cause diseases directly like skin cancer, or indirectly, through the vegetables and animals that we eat, like food poisoning.

Looking at all of these effects of pollution, “why don’t we just stop polluting?” someone might wonder. The answer is we cannot just stop because we need to keep the industries to produce goods that we use in our daily lives, we need to use our vehicles to commute, and we need to deforest and to make constructions because the world’s population is growing. Pollution cannot be prevented entirely, but can be controlled. Many nations and international organizations have enacted laws and legislations to control pollution and minimize its effects.
