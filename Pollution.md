I am going to use the two links above to do my research and use the information I learn to write my paper


Pollution is the process of endangering the environment. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy. In this paper I am going to discuss the effects of air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution. Then I will try to discuss some solutions to pollution in general. 


Air pollution is the most permanent and dangerous type of pollution. It is defined as the release of both natural and manmade substances to the atmosphere. It includes the burning of fossil fuels in vehicle engines and in industries, dangerous gases like sulfur dioxide, tobacco smoke, and dust. The effects of air pollution are enormous. Sulfur dioxide and other harmful gases contribute in global warming. Breathing polluted air can cause humans to get disease like asthma and cancer.


Water pollution is the release of contaminates to the water, which is usually caused by water littering. It takes many forms including trash getting disposed directly in the water, industrial waste dumped into water, and accidental oil spills. Water pollution directly affects the aquatic beings, which in turn might affect humans depending on these through the food chain causing serious diseases such as cholera. 


Soil or land pollution is the destruction of earth’s surface and soil. It can take many forms including deforestation and soil erosions, agricultural activates, construction activities, and nuclear waste. These types of soil pollution can have sever effects on the environment. Deforestation and construction activates directly harm the wildlife by destroying their habitat. Land pollution can also have serious effects on human health. Land contamination can directly cause diseases like skin cancer, or indirectly through the vegetables and animals that we eat. 


Looking at all of these effects of pollution someone might wonder, why not just stop polluting. The answer is we cannot just stop because we need to keep the industries to produce goods that we use in our daily lives, we need to use our vehicles to commute, we need to deforest and to make constructions because the world’s population is growing. Pollution cannot be prevented entirely, but can be controlled. Many nations and international organizations have enacted laws and legislations to control pollution and minimize its effects.
